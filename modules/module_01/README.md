## Module 1: Introduction to the SDAccel Flow

<br>

This module is divided in 3 labs. It is recommended to complete each lab before proceeding to the next.

1. **Running "Hello World"** \
You will get familiar with the steps involved in running a simple application on the F1 instance. [Start this lab.](lab_01_helloworld.md)

1. **Developing and optimizing F1 applications with SDAccel** \
You will use the SDAccel development environment to create, profile and optimize an F1 accelerator. The lab focuses on the Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT), a compute intensive function used at the heart of all video codecs. [Start this lab.](lab_02_idct.md)

1. **Wrap-up and next steps** \
You will to close your RDP session, stop your F1 instance and explore next steps to continue your F1 experience after the Xilinx Developer Lab. [Start this lab.](lab_03_wrap_up.md)

Since building FPGA binaries is not instantaneous, all the modules of this Developer Lab will use precompiled FPGA binaries.
